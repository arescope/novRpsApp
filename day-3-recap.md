## Finish First Feature on frontend

Pairs started the morning by finishing up the first feature. 

## Component Testing Strategy Tradeoffs

We then talked, after the fact, about the tradeoffs in our component testing strategy. We discovered that although all of the tests passed, our application didn't work. 

## UML

We updated the UML, and discovered new boundaries.

## Second Feature—HLP

For our second feature, we started by asking ourselves: "What new concern does this introduce into our codebase?"

We learned new patterns and techniques to implement the backend: 
* Repository Pattern
* Fakes
* Contract Tests

We also examined contract tests in the light of the dependency inversion principle.

And lastly, we refactored the tests according to the principle: "Make the change easy, Then make the easy change."

## Second feature—LLD

You finished the story on your own.
