Here's a reminder of what we covered today.

"Everyone believes their way is the right way; everyone is wrong." 

## Best Practices v. Patterns 

Best Practice definition: something you should always do regardless of context. "Do this, and your life will be better."

Pattern definition: a practice that has pros and cons, and is appropriate in some situations, and not others. 

Examples of best practices: 
* Syntax highlighting
* Source control

Examples of patterns:
* TDD
* Pair Programming
* Code Review
* Stories
* Estimation


## XP Values

We covered five values: 

* Communication
* Respect
* Courage
* Simplicity
* Feedback


## TDD

We started by concisely describing TDD and Tests.

Next, we did the RPS Kata in Java. Some things we paid special attention to: 
* Calling the shot!
* Watching out for untested logic
* Refactoring

Next, we covered why we do TDD in the first place: 
* GO FAST FOREVER
* CLEAN CODE
* REFACTORING
* CONFIDENCE
* TDD

We talked through the qualities of good test suites:
* FAST
* CLEAN
* CONFIDENCE
* FREEDOM TO REFACTOR

And lastly, we introduced the XP Principle, "Assume Simplicity", and thought about that in the context of the RPS kata. 
  
## DIP

First, we talked about the most ubiquitous pattern in all of software development: the "Ball of Mud" pattern. This is the reason that we study the dependency inversion principleâ€”it's one of several tools we should all have in our toolbox to help us combat the ball of mud. 

We started by looking at the following definitions: 
* source code dependencies oppose the runtime flow of control
* seperation of concerns
* high level policy independent of low level detail
* depend in the direction of stability
* polymorphism  

Next, we talked about the first documented case of DIP in the wild: Teradyne!     

Then, we paper coded the Smart Home challenge, and illustrated the technical definition of DIP (both the violation and solution) via code + UML. 

Next, we refactored the temp regulator algorithm to apply the dependency inversion principle.

And lastly, we paired on the Smart Home TDD Kata, and introduce the five types of test doubles: 
* Dummy
* Stub
* Spy
* Mock
* Fake

And we started to learn the rules of thumb for when to use one double versus another.
